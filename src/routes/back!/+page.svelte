<h1>Back!</h1>
<body>
    <br> "Back!" 
    <br> An exclaim to stop the return
    <br> It's back.
    <br> A cry to stifle a slow death
    <br> A weak desperate cry
    <br> 
    <br> Two pendulums hit: crash!
    <br> They revolt and twirl away 
    <br> Emerging from the embers: a river
    <br> Water dances, falling from the rocks to the grove 
    <br> Green, magnificent green makes the air thick
    <br> And within it, a slight wind pulls the leaves into the undergrowth
    <br> They spin and tumble to the--crash!
    <br> 
    <br> "Back!"
    <br> An exclaim to stop the return
    <br> It's back.
    <br> A cry to stifle a slow death
    <br> A weak desperate cry
