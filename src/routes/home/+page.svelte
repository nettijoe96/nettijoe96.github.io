<h1>Home</h1>
<body>
    <br> Outward--soaring!
    <br> On an open night--nothing
    <br> Grabbing--to rest off
    <br> Rest easy, rest clear
    <br> And steer the ship
    <br> Towards shimmering
    <br> Distinctly specific 
    <br> Reflections of Him
    <br> Calling me back--home  
</body>
