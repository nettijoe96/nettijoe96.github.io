<h1>The Matchbox</h1>
<body>
    <br> The man wears
    <br> Leather boots
    <br> Caked with mud
    <br> From years past
    <br> 
    <br> He crouches
    <br> Blowing soft
    <br> On hot coals
    <br> In the stove
    <br> 
    <br> In the smoke
    <br> The embers
    <br> Fall and fail
    <br> Raining ash
    <br> 
    <br> Papa, dad
    <br> His son cries
    <br> Try again
    <br> One more time
    <br> 
    <br> The man bends
    <br> His head low
    <br> And blows hard
    <br> But nothing
    <br> 
    <br> Son, listen
    <br> It was easy
    <br> Years ago
    <br> But no more
    <br> 
    <br> Father, dad
    <br> I know not
    <br> Of your fire
    <br> Nor my own
    <br> 
    <br> But I know
    <br> Fires are lit
    <br> From with out
    <br> Not within
    <br> 
    <br> Let us go
    <br> Somewhere else
    <br> And we shall
    <br> Find a match
    <br> 
    <br> And with that
    <br> The two left
    <br> For the hills
    <br> Far beyond
    <br> 
    <br> Over the sea
    <br> Towards the sky
    <br> Following
    <br> The north star
