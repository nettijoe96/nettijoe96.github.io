            > Listen to the wake of the world fly by 
            As a bird leaves its wings

            You don't know why, how, what, who, 
            when you do ride off into the sunset.
            So grab a candle with me

            Grab a candle with me
            And listen to its body whistle
            It will never come again

            Ever in a million dreams
            Past the crescent moon
            The early grove

            It will never 
            Come again
        </div>
    </div>
