<h1>Forgive</h1>
<body>
    <br> Listen to the wake of the world fly by 
    <br> As a bird leaves its wings
    <br>
    <br> You don't know why, how, what, who, 
    <br> when you do ride off into the sunset.
    <br> So grab a candle with me
    <br>
    <br> Grab a candle with me
    <br> And listen to its body whistle
    <br> It will never come again
    <br>
    <br> Ever in a million dreams
    <br> Past the crescent moon
    <br> The early grove
    <br>
    <br> It will never 
    <br> Come again
</body>
