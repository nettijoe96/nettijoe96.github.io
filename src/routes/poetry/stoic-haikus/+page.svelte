    <br> Take what's for granted.                     
    <br> Use it with daily comforts                                                 
    <br> Watch it disappear  
    <br> 
    <br> Loose something needed.                      
    <br> Become ultimately free                                                     
    <br> Cherish everything
    <br> 
    <br> Looking for the gold.                               
    <br> Only the silver appears                          
    <br> Better anyways.
