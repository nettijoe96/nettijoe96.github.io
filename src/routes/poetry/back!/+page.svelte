    <h1>Back!</h1>
    <div class="poem">
        <div class="poemtext"
            > "Back!" 
            An exclaim to stop the return
            It's back.
            A cry to stifle a slow death
            A weak desperate cry
            
            Two pendulums hit: crash!
            They revolt and twirl away 
            Emerging from the embers: a river
            Water dances, falling from the rocks to the grove 
            Green, magnificent green makes the air thick
            And within it, a slight wind pulls the leaves into the undergrowth
            They spin and tumble to the--crash!
            
            "Back!"
            An exclaim to stop the return
            It's back.
            A cry to stifle a slow death
            A weak desperate cry
        </div>
