<h1>A Door For Change</h1>
<body>
    <br> In my kingdom of lead
    <br> A wise man once said
    <br> "You can't change the world"
    <br> And it's true--(but fuck it).
    <br> 
    <br> It's <em>hard</em> to change.
    <br> And <em>now</em>adays ...
    <br> My brain is like a maze 
    <br> and my head like is a penny jar
    <br> Shoot, <em>one</em> tw--WAIT!
    <br> Pace the world, <em>face</em> the world
    <br> Change: be em<em>braced</em>
    <br> Phased: no <em>way</em>-(fuck it)
    <br> Hazed: I <em>swear</em>
    <br> 
    <br> Leave me to <em>dry</em>
    <br> Heave a sigh of <em>relief</em> ... 
    <br> An open heart for <em>belief</em> 
    <br> and <em>beneath</em> the sky
    <br> Falls an open door
    <br> Falls rain once more
    <br> Reins in this insane wind
    <br> Heavenly gates: adore
</body>
