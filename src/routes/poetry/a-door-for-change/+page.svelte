            > In my kingdom of lead
            A wise man once said
            "You can't change the world"
            And it's true--(but fuck it).
            
            It's <em>hard</em> to change.
            And <em>now</em>adays ...
            My brain is like a maze 
            and my head like is a penny jar
            Shoot, <em>one</em> tw--WAIT!
            Pace the world, <em>face</em> the world
            Change: be em<em>braced</em>
            Phased: no <em>way</em>-(fuck it)
            Hazed: I <em>swear</em> ...
            
            Leave me to <em>dry</em>.
            Heave a sigh of <em>relief</em> ... 
            An open heart for <em>belief</em> 
            and <em>beneath</em> the sky
            Falls an open door
            Falls rain once more
            Reins in this insane wind
            Heavenly gates: adore
        </div>
