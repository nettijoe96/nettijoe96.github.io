<h1>A boy sits upon a tower</h1>
<body>
    <br> A boy sits upon a tower
    <br> And cries to the sun 
    <br> To the stars
    <br> Alas alas where are you
    <br> My fine maiden
    <br> Alas where are you
    <br> My dear
    <br> 
    <br> A boy sits upon a tower
    <br> Hugged by the wind
    <br> He says
    <br> “Hold me close”
    <br> He says to the wind
    <br> “Hold me”
    <br> Alas alas where are you
    <br> My dear
    <br> Alas, my fine maiden
    <br> Where are you
    <br> 
    <br> A boy sits upon tower 
    <br> That he built in the desert
    <br> He cannot get down.
    <br> He sits upon a tower
    <br> And sees his mother weeping
    <br> Alas alas my boy
    <br> Where are you
    <br> Alas where are you
    <br> My dear
    <br> 
    <br> A boy sits upon a tower
    <br> On a lone dark night
    <br> Fast asleep
    <br> He dreams of an axe 
    <br> Crashing through a black thicket 
    <br> Of branches and sticks
    <br> 
    <br> He dreams silly dreams
    <br> That cannot come true
    <br> Sailing ships 
    <br> Silky streams
    <br> He remembers her smile
    <br> Enveloped and full 
    <br> Like wildfire — her eyes
    <br> Forging anew
    <br> 
    <br> Alas alas where are you
    <br> Alas where are you 
    <br> My dear
    <br> Alas alas maiden so fine
    <br> Alas where are you 
    <br> My dear
