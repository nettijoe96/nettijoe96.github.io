            > A boy sits upon a tower
            And cries to the sun 
            To the stars
            Alas alas where are you
            My fine maiden
            Alas where are you
            My dear
            
            A boy sits upon a tower
            Hugged by the wind
            He says
            “Hold me close”
            He says to the wind
            “Hold me”
            Alas alas where are you
            My dear
            Alas, my fine maiden
            Where are you
            
            A boy sits upon tower 
            That he built in the desert
            He cannot get down.
            He sits upon a tower
            And sees his mother weeping
            Alas alas my boy
            Where are you
            Alas where are you
            My dear
            
            A boy sits upon a tower
            On a lone dark night
            Fast asleep
            He dreams of an axe 
            Crashing through a black thicket 
            Of branches and sticks
            
            He dreams silly dreams
            That cannot come true
            Sailing ships 
            Silky streams
            He remembers her smile
            Enveloped and full 
            Like wildfire — her eyes
            Forging anew
            
            Alas alas where are you
            Alas where are you 
            My dear
            Alas alas maiden so fine
            Alas where are you 
            My dear
